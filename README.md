# Goal
PsyArXivBot is a bot tailored for the Bluesky platform. It posts new preprints from PsyArXiv.

# Credits
This project is based on the bsky-bot Template (https://github.com/philnash/bsky-bot) by Phil Nash (philnash). The foundation provided by the original template was instrumental in the creation of PsyArXivBot.

We've made specific modifications to tailor the bot to our needs, but we wholeheartedly acknowledge and appreciate the foundational work provided by the original author. A big thank you to Phil Nash for his contribution to the open-source community!
